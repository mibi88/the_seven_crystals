THE 7 CRYSTALS

You explore dungeons and fight mobs, that give you xp. You will be able to use
this XP to summon a boss that you will be able to fight and get a crystal. With
the seven crysals you will be able to summon a big boss that lets you exit the
dungeon.

I think that it is the ugliest piece of C that I've ever written.
